A very simple timer app with MVVM, flow and coroutines. A very clean app that uses animated borders,
animated ripple effect and a progress bar as soon as the timer goes on. It has 3 modes Start, pause and stop.
It is not the most beautiful but demonstrates all the concepts

Touching the square begins the timer and again touching pauses it also generating a ripple effect, reset by stop button.
